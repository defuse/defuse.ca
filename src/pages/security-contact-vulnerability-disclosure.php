<h1>Security Contact and Vulnerability Disclosure</h1>

<p>
You are permitted to try and hack, without fear of prosecution, the
public-facing servers I run and own as long as you alert me immediately once you
succeed and make your best effort not to deny service to any of my users.
Currently, the only server that falls under this agreement is the one at the IP
address that <code>defuse.ca</code> resolves to. This does <em>not</em> include
my personal email, my employer's websites, or other systems running in the same
datacenter as one of my servers (that I don't own).
</p>

<p>
If you find a bug in any of my services or software, please immediately disclose
it to the public and then <a href="/contact.htm">email me about it</a>. The best
way to do that is to open an issue on the project's GitHub issue tracker. An
alternative is to send an email to the Full Disclosure mailing list.
</p>

<p>
If you feel uncomfortable disclosing a vulnerability to the public without first
notifying me, you are welcome to contact me first, but it is unnecessary.

<strong>Backdoor Insertion Proof-of-Concept Bounty:</strong> I'll give $100 USD 
to anyone who can trick me into inserting the string "BackdoorPoCTwitter" into 
a release of any of my software projects.
