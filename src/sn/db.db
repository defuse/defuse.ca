NAT Routers as Firewalls
Most people don't think of common NAT routers as hardware firewalls, but ANY NAT router inherently provides terrific security and protection against incoming malicious traffic. Learn how and why this is, and which default settings MUST be changed to lock down the security of your NAT router.

Personal Password Policy
Everyone who uses web-based services such as eBay, Amazon, and Yahoo, needs to authenticate their identity with passwords. Password quality is important since easily guessable passwords can be easily defeated. Leo and I recap a bit from last week's program, then discuss passwords. We suggest an approach that anyone can use to easily create unbreakable passwords.

Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are occurring with ever-greater frequency every day. Although these damaging attacks are often used to extort high-profile gaming and gambling sites before major gambling events, attacks are also launched against individual users who do something to annoy "zombie fleet masters" while they are online. Some router and firewall vendors claim that their devices prevent DDoS attacks. Is that possible? What can be done to dodge the bullet of a DDoS attack launched against you while you're online?

Sony's "Rootkit Technology" DRM
Leo and I discuss details and consequences of Sony Corporation's alarming "Rootkit" DRM (digital rights management) copy protection scheme. This poorly written software unnecessarily employs classic rootkit technology (see episode #9) to hide from its users after installation. It can not be uninstalled easily, it can be easily misused for malicious purposes, and it has been implicated in many repeated BSOD "blue screen of death" PC crashes.

VPN Secure Tunneling Solutions
Leo and I discuss the use of SSL and SSH encrypted tunneling for providing privacy and security whenever an insecure local network is being used &#151; such as at an open WiFi hotspot or when using a hotel's network. These solutions are not transparent and tend to be configuration intensive. They also require the use of a "server" of some sort at the user's home or office. This makes these approaches less suitable for casual users, but offers a solution for the more technically inclined road warriors.

I describe exactly how it works in an effort to explain why it doesn't have the feeling of another Microsoft "coding error". It has the feeling of something that Microsoft deliberately designed into Windows. Given the nature of what it is, this would make it a remote code execution "backdoor". We will likely never know if this was the case, but the forensic evidence appears to be quite compelling.<br><img src="/image/transpixel.gif" width=1 height=8 border=0><br><center><a href="http://www.grc.com/wmf/wmf.htm">Download "MouseTrap" &#150; our free MICE tester</a> (29 kb)</center>

We discuss the importance of, and solutions to, private key recovery using varying numbers of trustees.  And conclude by explaining the need for, and the operation of, security certificates.

Browser Security
Leo and I discuss the broad topic of web browser security.  We examine the implications of running "client-side" code in the form of interpreted scripting languages such as Java, JavaScript, and VBScript, and also the native object code contained within browser "plug-ins" including Microsoft's ActiveX.  I outline the "zone-based" security model used by IE and explain how I surf with high security under IE, only "lowering my shields" to a website after I've had the chance to look around and decide that the site looks trustworthy.

Buffer Overruns
In one of our more "aggressively technical" episodes, Leo and I discuss the pernicious nature of software security bugs from the programmer's perspective. We explain how "the system stack" functions, then provide a detailed look at exactly how a small programming mistake can allow executable code to be remotely injected into a computer system despite the best intentions of security-conscious programmers.

NAT Traversal
Leo and I delve into the inner workings of NAT routers.

Leo and I discuss the updated second version of our Perfect Paper Passwords (PPP) system and examine a number of interesting subtle questions such as whether it's better to have fully random equally probable passwords or true one-time-only passwords; and how, whether, and why attack strategies affect that decision.

Network Congestion
Leo and I discuss an aspect of the "cost" of using the Internet - a packetized global network which (only) offers "best effort" packet delivery service.  Since "capacity" is the cost, not per-packet usage, the cost is the same whether the network is used or not.  But once it becomes "overused" the economics change since "congestion" results in a sudden loss of network performance.

Google's Chrome
Leo and I examine Google's new &#8220;Chrome&#8221; web browser.

SockStress
Leo and I discuss a class of newly disclosed vulnerabilities reported to exist in many operating systems' implementations of the fundamental TCP protocol. Two security researchers, claiming that they could not get anyone's attention (after less than one month), disclosed far too much information in a recent audio interview &#8212; leaving little to the imagination &#8212; and exposing the Internet to a new class of DoS attacks. They'll certainly get attention now. (See this episode's <a href="http://www.grc.com/sn/notes-164.htm">Show Notes</a> for many additional links.)

The Geek Atlas, IPv6 & a non-VPN
Steve and Leo explore three topics this week: A terrific new book for geeks and non-geeks alike, the uncertain future of IPv6 (and a few cautions about rushing to adoption) and a idea Steve has been mulling around for a "lightweight" means for making secure Internet connections with a VPN tunnel.

A security vulnerability in SSL

The Rational Rejection of Security Advice

Indirection: The Power of Pointers
A feature present in the earliest commercial computers, known as &#8220;indirection&#8221;, has proven to be necessary, powerful, beneficial<b>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</b> and amazingly dangerous and difficult for programmers to &#8220;get right&#8221;. This week, Leo and I examine the Power of Pointers and why, even after all these years, they continue to bedevil programmers of all ages.

Side-Channel Privacy Leakage

What's surprising is that when all of these individual non-unique bits are gathered together and assembled into a single &#8220;fingerprint,&#8221; the result IS often unique and can thereby be used as a tracking fingerprint to identify individual users' movements as they surf.
